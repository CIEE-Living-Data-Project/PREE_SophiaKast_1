Sophia's repository for assignment in the Living Data Project course, 'Productivity and Reproducibility in Ecology and Evolution.'

This repository contains data, scripts, and outputs (pre-registration and manuscript) associated with a mini-project for the above course. I use data borrowed from the following url <https://whitlockschluter3e.zoology.ubc.ca/Data/chapter12/chap12e4ChinookWithBrookTrout.csv>. This data describes the survival of Chinook salmon juveniles in the Salmon River watershed in Idaho, US, in two treatment types: brook trout presence or absence. I visualize the data using a few methods.
