This is data pulled from the following url: https://whitlockschluter3e.zoology.ubc.ca/Data/chapter12/chap12e4ChinookWithBrookTrout.csv

This data shows 12 different sites in the Salmon River watershed in Idaho. At each site, brook trout are either present or absent (two treatments). The raw column 'nReleased' describes the number of juvenile salmon tagged and released at each site in the fall. The raw column 'nSurvivors' indicates the number of tagged juvenile salmon that were still surviving at Lower Granite Dam the following spring. The raw column 'proportionSurvived' shows the number of surviving salmon divided by the number of released juvenile salmon for each site. 

A column showing the site number (1-12) was added to the data frame. Additionally, each of the four raw columns were renamed for clarity. A new cvs file was written containing the cleaned up data.
