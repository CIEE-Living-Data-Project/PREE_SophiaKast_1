# README

This folder contains the manuscript created from the scripts and data. 

It also contains necessary files for creating a tidy, properly-cited manuscript, including .csl and .bib files. 

This manuscript is intended to be able to render independently of the external scripts, pending successful instalment of the package ```groundhog```.
