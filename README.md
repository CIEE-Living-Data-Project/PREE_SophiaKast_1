# PREE_SophiaKast
Sophia's repository for assignment in the Living Data Project course, 'Productivity and Reproducibility in Ecology and Evolution.'

This repository contains data, scripts, and outputs (pre-registration and manuscript) associated with a mini-project for the above course. I use data borrowed from the following url <https://whitlockschluter3e.zoology.ubc.ca/Data/chapter12/chap12e4ChinookWithBrookTrout.csv>. This data describes the survival of Chinook salmon juveniles in the Salmon River watershed in Idaho, US, in two treatment types: brook trout presence or absence. I visualize the data using a few methods. 

The manuscript (located within the directory 'manuscript') is intended to render without running any of the external scripts, as long as the project is entirely downloaded to the users local repository. To successfully render will require installation of the package ```groundhog```. See further instructions in the 'scripts' README.
