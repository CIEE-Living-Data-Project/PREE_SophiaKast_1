# README

These scripts import the raw data into RStudio from a url, clean up the data, write a new .csv file, and conduct a few visualizations of the data. 

These scripts shouldn't need to run in order to render manuscript. If the scripts do require running, run in the following order: 

1. Project_Setup_Script.R (**run this script only once**)

2. Data_Load_Cleanup.R

3. Plot_Data.R

4. install_grateful.R
